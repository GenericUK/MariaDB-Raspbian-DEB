# MariaDB Raspbian DEB
Raspberry Pi Raspbian compiled DEB Debian Package of MariaDB MySQL replacement.

Compiled with checkinstall on Pi2 | Raspbian GNU/Linux 7 (wheezy) | Kernel 3.18.11-v7+

Compiling MariaDB was a bit of a trick on Raspian as it requires gcc & g++ packages to be upgraded to 4.8 which isn't available in wheezy/Raspian 7, it also takes several hours and requires about 2Gb on your wee Pi. Shame to waste my work so its here if you need it.

PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOU SYSTEM ESPECIALLY ANY EXISTING MYSQL DATABASES, THIS INSTALLED ON MY SYSTEM FINE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL ON YOURS.

# PRE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

I'm writing them now...
